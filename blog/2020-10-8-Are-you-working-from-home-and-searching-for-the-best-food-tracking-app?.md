The following comments of fellow users of [Lilbite](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lilbite.ai&referrer=utm_source%3Dlilbite_web) could be relatable to you, whether you are a beginner or a professional health tracker. 
	•	Routine developments
You will be able to understand about your everyday food and drink intake pattern by tracking the time and amount of intake. 
“I was able to recognize that the snacks that I eat had more calories than the meals that I consume.”
	•	Split second awareness
You will be able to recognize whether you are truly hungry or not when you pause and monitor the food before consuming.
“I was able to recognize that I consumed more food during food preparation than while actually eating.”
	•	Recognize the various nutrients
You will be able to select the nutrients that you like to concentrate on, such as sugars, saturated fats or sodium, according to your health requirements. 
“Until I began tracking my food intake, I had no idea that my intake in fiber food was below the daily average suggestion of 25 grams.”

Advices from a tracker who has been actively tracking food and activity for ten years:

	•	You have to follow perseverance. Try to log five days without pause.
Similar to other talents, tracking is also a learning curve. You need to practice if you need to understand a specific aspect. Similarly, you must also consider logging your intake a skill. 
	•	The crucial aspect for deciding precise calorie intake is through the precise decision of food portion size. 
Understanding the size of portion will take some time. Portion distortion is a term that everyone has probably heard of. The portions of food and calorie that we consume has amplified over the past fifty years. A donut that used to be 100 calories before ten years is now more than 400 calories.
You need to calculate your intake with the help of your measuring cup.

	•	“Until I began measuring my breakfast cereal, I had no idea I had been eating way too much.”
	•	As soon as you arrange the exercise setting, choose the “sedentary” exercise option, even if you follow lots of movement. 
	•	Several users underestimate the food intake and overestimate exercise. 
	•	Choosing this option will enable an accurate tracking of calories from exercise.
